            <p class="readme">A simple 'guess-the-member' game to help you remember the boys faces/names. <br>At first it was just a small-side project to help me learn the basics of JS and HTML/CSS
                but if you're a new Atiny and struggle to recognize them then 'enjoy' I guess :D <br/> As a reminder the boys names are : Hongjoong, Jongho, Mingi, San, Seonghwa, Wooyoung, Yeosang, Yunho.
                <br/>You can write them in lowercase/uppercase as long as it's written as above.
